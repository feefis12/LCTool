# LCTool
A tool that creates static 'album' videos using an image file + music files. Also generates timestamps and custom descriptions.

Tool is split up into 2 major components: Cover + Video
-------------------------------------------------------------
Cover tool allows for the creation of 1920 x 1080 .png files which center the image file 
and allow for the sides to be filled with a color that supports the image.

Video tool takes multiple (or a single) music files, concatenates them and generates a video the length of the album.
It also creates timestamps designating the start time of each file within the album.


1. Run mainMenu.py

*For Windows users* there is a .exe in the build directory.
